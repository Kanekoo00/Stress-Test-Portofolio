Yeaaaah, this is one step forward to become QE.

# Stress Test Portfolio - JMeter

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates stress testing implementation using Apache JMeter to analyze system behavior under extreme load conditions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Apache JMeter
- Java JDK
- CSV Data Config
- GitHub

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify system limit under heavy traffic
- Measure response time & throughput
- Observe server failure point
- Evaluate system stability
- 
## Test Scenarios
  I have 2 test scenarios :
- Total Requests: 5,000
- Target: PetStore Swagger API
- Goal: Push the system beyond normal load

===========================================
- Total Requests: 5,000
- Target: PetStore Swagger API
- Goal: Push the system beyond normal load

## Result Summary

- [Result Summary)(https://github.com/Kanekoo00/Stress-Test-Portofolio/tree/main/reports)

## Conclusion
 - The system remains functionally stable, but experiences significant performance degradation. Response times exceed acceptable limits, even though no failures.
